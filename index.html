                <p>As <strong><a href="https://www.example.com/">Acme Corporation</a></strong>, we consider the security
                    of our projects a top priority. But no matter how much effort we put into security, there can still
                    be vulnerabilities present. If you discover a vulnerability in one of the projects directly
                    developed by us, we would like to know about it so we can take steps to address it as quickly as
                    possible, while protecting. We would like to ask you to help us better protect our users and their
                    data.</p>

                <p>This policy describes how to send us vulnerability reports and how we ask security researchers to
                    behave when disclosing vulnerabilities. Your personal data will be processed based on your consent
                    and in accordance with our <a href="https://www.example.com/privacy-policy/">privacy policy</a>.</p>

                <h2 id="report-a-vulnerability">Report a vulnerability</h2>
                <p>E-mail your findings to <a href="mailto:security@example.com">security@example.com</a>. Encrypt your
                    findings using our <a href="https://www.example.com/publickey.txt">PGP key</a> to prevent this
                    critical information from falling into the wrong hands.</p>

                <p>Give adequate information allowing the vulnerability to be reproduced, so we will be able to resolve
                    it as quickly as possible. In particular please include at least the following information:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>type of vulnerability;</li>
                    <li>service or URL or IPs affected;</li>
                    <li>requirements to reproduce the issue;</li>
                    <li>information necessary to reproduce the issue;</li>
                    <li>impact of the vulnerability together with an explanation of how an attacker could find it and
                        exploit it.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="guidelines">Guidelines</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do not take advantage of the vulnerability or problem you have discovered.</li>
                    <li>Do not perform any activity that can damage us or our users, disrupt the impacted system or
                        service or cause any data leakage/loss.</li>
                    <li>Respect the privacy of our users: you are not allowed to use any personal data for purposes
                        other than protect our users and their data, in accordance with this policy.</li>
                    <li>Keep confidential any information about discovered vulnerabilities for up to 90 calendar days
                        after you have notified Acme Corporation, unless mutually agreed otherwise.</li>
                    <li>Do not place a backdoor in a system. By placing a backdoor in a system, that system becomes even
                        more insecure.</li>
                    <li>Do not make changes to the system or application.</li>
                    <li>Do not use Denial of Service attacks or brute force access.</li>
                    <li>Do not use aggressive automated scanning.</li>
                    <li>Do not use social engineering of our employees or contractors.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="what-we-promise">What we promise</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>We will respond to a valid submission within 7 business days with our evaluation of the report
                        and an expected resolution date.</li>
                    <li>If you have followed the instructions above, we will not take any legal action against you
                        concerning the report.</li>
                    <li>We will not pass on your personal details to third parties without your permission, unless it is
                        necessary to comply with a legal obligation. Reporting under a pseudonym or anonymous is
                        possible.</li>
                    <li>We will keep you informed of the progress towards resolving the problem.</li>

                <p>This text describes the vulnerability disclosure
                    policy for the ficticious company
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_Corporation">
                        Acme Corporation
                    </a> and it is based on the <a href="https://io.italia.it/security.html">
                        Vulnerability Disclosure Policy</a> published by
                    <a href="https://www.pagopa.gov.it/">PagoPA S.p.A</a>.
                    Before re-using this text, at least change the
                    company name, the email address and the matching PGP
                    key. To make the policy easier to find, it's
                    recommended to publish it at a standard location
                    (<a href="https://www.example.com/security">www.example.com/security</a>).
                </p>

                <p>It's recommended to clearly define the
                    acceptable targets and methods of attack. The
                    example text should be suitable for most
                    organizations, but some organizations might have
                    some concerns that are specific to their product or
                    infrastructure.</p>

                <p>Organizations and hackers are encouraged to give
                    feedback on this text. Feedback will be used to
                    improve the text to ensure that this text can be
                    re-used as much as possible.</p>
